# Markov_Switching_Model
Changes in stock prices at any time can happen randomly in accordance with the will of the market. The up-normal changes that are not just a moment or change over a certain period and repeated in the other period can also occur so that there is a shift in the pattern of changes in stock prices. This shift is categorized as a changing of the model structure. Detection of such pattern changes can be predicted using the Markov Switching Model (MSwM). Using the smallest size of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) model on stock price data modeling using MSwM, it will be possible to determine how many Markov transitions occur in the stock price movement. If in the daily price data found as much as the state Markov transition, then there are as much as the number of state Markov transition of regime model within the daily price movement of the stock.
